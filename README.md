# Emotion Detection System

An AI-powered real-time **Emotion Detection System** that detects faces and recognizes emotions from a webcam feed. The system uses a pre-trained deep learning model to classify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and more.

---

## 📸 Features
- Real-time **Face Detection** using OpenCV's Haar Cascade.
- Emotion recognition with a pre-trained `_mini_XCEPTION` model.
- Visual representation of emotion probabilities.
- Works with live video input (webcam).

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-detection-system.git
cd emotion-detection-system

2. Set Up Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies

Install the required libraries:

pip install tensorflow keras numpy opencv-python imutils

🚀 Running the Project

Run the script:

python face_detection.py

Key Features
	1.	Live Webcam Feed:
	•	Detects faces and displays bounding boxes.
	•	Predicts and shows emotions with probabilities.
	2.	Exit:
	•	Press q to quit the program.

📦 Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required:
	•	TensorFlow
	•	Keras
	•	OpenCV
	•	NumPy
	•	Imutils

Install them using:

pip install tensorflow keras numpy opencv-python imutils

🛠️ How It Works
	1.	Face Detection:
	•	The Haar Cascade (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) detects faces in video frames.
	2.	Emotion Prediction:
	•	The _mini_XCEPTION.102-0.66.hdf5 model predicts emotions for detected faces.
	3.	Display:
	•	Bounding boxes and emotion labels are displayed on the webcam feed.

🎯 Future Enhancements
	•	Support for detecting multiple faces.
	•	Add more emotions like confusion, excitement, etc.
	•	GPU acceleration for better performance.
	•	Save video output with detected emotions.
